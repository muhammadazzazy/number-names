# Number Names
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes a number from the user and prints to the console the English name of the number.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

First, a virtual environment can be created and activated using the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Then, the required Python packages need to be installed which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects#numbers](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
